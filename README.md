# Data-FX
Data-FX is an addon for Blender (2.9) that allows for the visualization of data with different charts

Currently, there are only 2 chart options...

- A Scatter plot which plots up to 3 values in 3d space
- And a "Map plot" that visualizes points on a sphere when given longitudes and latitudes

## Below are some examples
